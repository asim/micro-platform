# Platform

The micro platform is a self hosted platform for microservices development.

## Overview

Our goal is to provide an fully automated solution to manage a serverless platform for microservices. 
This project serves as the entry point for that, leveraging the [Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro) 
runtime to do so along with extra dashboards and automation to run on any cloud platform. The 
platform is built as a kubernetes native deployment.
